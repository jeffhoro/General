# 🧠 Jeff Horowitz — Data Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my portfolio of work in **data science**, **analytics**, and **machine learning**, using tools such as **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**. My projects span topics including classification, recommendation systems, optimization, and data visualization.

## 📂 Example Project Areas 

### 🔍 Predictive Modeling
Projects focused on building machine learning models to predict outcomes such as user conversion, product ratings, or customer behavior. Techniques include classification, regression, and gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).

### 📊 Data Visualization & Insights
Dashboards and visualizations built using Python (matplotlib, seaborn) and R (ggplot2), with a focus on communicating results clearly to stakeholders.

### 🤖 Recommender Systems
Projects involving collaborative filtering, content-based recommendations, and hybrid approaches applied to domains like product reviews.

### 🧪 Experiment Design & A/B Testing
Includes work designing controlled experiments to evaluate the business impact of models or strategies, measuring metrics like conversion lift and uplift.
